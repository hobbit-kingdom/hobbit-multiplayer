To run the project build it in x86 Release or Debug. Build Server and Client part seperately on the right side of the Visual Studio.

Make sure to add file FAKE_BILBOS.EXPORT to the level folder, 
modify ALLUSEDLAYERS.TXT and INTITIAL_LAYERS.TXT by adding "FAKE_BILBOS" line to them 
and increasing total counter of them at the top by 1 in both files.

Better method will be released later.

After you've launched the level run Server.exe on your PC. Make sure that you are in the same local network as your friends PC (you can use Radmin VPN or Hamachi to achieve that if you are not on the same network).
Your friend has to run Client.exe on their PC after he has launched the level and make sure that in the same folder he has server_ip.txt file where he has your ip written on the first line.
Levels must be modified ( add FAKE_BILBOS.EXPORT to them as written above ) on both PC's.

At some point a modified version of the game will be released with all of this already built in.
