To run the project build it in x86 Release or Debug. Build Server and Client part seperately on the right side of the Visual Studio.

Make sure to add file FAKE_BILBOS.EXPORT to the level folder, 
modify ALLUSEDLAYERS.TXT and INTITIAL_LAYERS.TXT by adding "FAKE_BILBOS" line to them 
and increasing total counter of them at the top by 1 in both files.

Better method will be released later.
